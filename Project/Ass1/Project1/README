Projet 1 - Group 6
Authors : Julien Colmonts - Benoit Baufays
Use :
- makefile:
	* clean : remove compiled server.c, client.c & copied image (network2.jpg)
	* client : compile client.c
	* server : compile server.c
	* tserver : launch a sample server waiting on port 32000 - file created will be network2.jpg
	* tclient : launch a sample client trying to reach server on localhost (::1) on port 32000.
				File transmitted will be network.jpg.
- Using program:
	* server : compile server.c with makefile then you can execute it with 
							./server <port> <transmitted_filename>
	* client : compile client.c with makefile then you can execute it with
							./client <host (ipv6)> <port> <file_to_transmit>
	Care to use file name with './' as we did in makefile.

- Problems:
	* The program can't handle errors during transmission
	
Respectfully,

Group6.
