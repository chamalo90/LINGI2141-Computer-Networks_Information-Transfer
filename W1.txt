How to transmit a frame ?

10111 for example

 HEADER  PAYLOAD
|   101| 10111   |
----------------->
  1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1
 Payload   |
This solution works on a perfect line

Solutions with transmission errors
 Parity bit (detect one error)
 Bit stuffing ? (Ã  chercher...)

Using control frames (acknowlegement)
